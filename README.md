[00:23.44] I was just hiding from the words you left behind
[00:27.89] It makes me sick but also makes me feel alive
[00:32.03] Well did I never tried to provoke this case
[00:34.55] I'm the one who was trying to prevent this fate
[00:36.66] I was just doing fine making love with haze
[00:38.92] Until you came and kissed me on my youth
[00:58.92] 
[00:51.16] Since I have trust myself whatever comes what may
[00:55.46] From time to time my integrity comes in to play
[00:59.63] As I walk through the path of this world these days
[01:01.78] Why did I never mentioned this huge mistakes
[01:04.05] Well she told me its cuz of its awkward age
[01:06.79] So that I have tried my best
[01:20.79] 
[01:08.72] I've been singing I've been dreaming I've been doing everything
[01:10.85] But even though all I could do is just a bit and its kind a sad
[01:13.29] Such as screaming in the toilet and use all the toilet papers
[01:15.96] And polluting all the air producing carbon dioxide
[01:17.84] Now I had enough of it and now's the time to final it but
[01:20.34] Though I tried to kill myself my genius won't let go
[01:22.48] And so I'm here today again
[01:35.98] 
[01:50.05] I've been singing I've been dreaming I've been doing everything
[01:52.06] But even though all I could do is just a bit and its kind a sad
[01:54.37] Such as screaming in the toilet and use all the toilet papers
[01:56.53] And polluting all the air producing carbon dioxide
[01:59.01] Now I had enough of it and now's the time to final it but
[02:01.32] Though I tried to kill myself my genius won't let go
[02:03.44] Every time you call my name make me feel awake again And so ...
[02:34.94] 
[02:06.07] There's no time living twice a time
[02:08.13] But there's plenty of time living nice and high
[02:10.22] Well so am I, Am I? Am I? Am I?am I, Am I? Am I?
[02:12.74] There's no time for you to find it out
[02:15.72] But there's plenty of time for you to shout it out
[02:18.37] And so do I, Do I? Do I? Do I? do I, Do I? Do I? Do I?
[02:19.53] am I, Am I? Am I? Am I?am I, Am I? Am I? Am I?
